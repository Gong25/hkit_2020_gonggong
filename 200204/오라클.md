## JOIN
### CROSS JOIN
* CROSS JOIN(교차 조인) - 카디사안 곱(Cartesian Product)
  - SELECT * FROM department CROSS JOIN employee;  
  - SELECT * FROM department, employee;
### INNER JOIN
* INNER JOIN(내부 조인) - 모든 비교자(=, <, >, <=, >=) 사용 가능
  - SELECT * FROM employee INNER JOIN department ON employee.DNO=department.DNO;
  - SELECT * FROM employee JOIN department ON employee.DNO=department.DNO;
  - SELECT * FROM employee, department WHERE employee.DNO=department.DNO;
* EQUI JOIN(동일 조인) - 조건으로 동등 비교(=)만 사용 가능
  - SELECT * FROM employee JOIN department WHERE employee.DNO=department.DNO;  
  - SELECT * FROM employee, department WHERE employee.DNO=department.DNO;  
  - SELECT * FROM employee INNER JOIN department USING (DNO);
* NATURAL JOIN(자연 조인) - 자동으로 동일한 컬럼이 있는지를 조사해서 조인함
  - SELECT * FROM employee NATURAL JOIN department;
### OUTER JOIN 
* 무조건 INNER JOIN 보다는 검색 결과가 같거나 많음
* FULL OUTER JOIN
  - SELECT * FROM employee FULL OUTER JOIN department ON employee.DNO = department.DNO;
* LEFT OUTER JOIN
  - SELECT * FROM employee LEFT OUTER JOIN department ON employee.DNO = department.DNO;
* RIGHT OUTER JOIN
  - SELECT * FROM employee RIGHT OUTER JOIN department ON employee.DNO = department.DNO;

### 명시적, 암묵적 조인 비교
  - SELECT * FROM employee CROSS JOIN department;
  - SELECT * FROM employee INNER JOIN department;
  - SELECT * FROM employee JOIN department;
  - SELECT * FROM employee, department;
